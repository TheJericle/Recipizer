-Fix the unit system

-Make sure, whenever a number of recipes are request, the same recipe can't be returned several times (CHECK!)

-Add the feature so that the number of people is taken into account (Check!)

-Add a feature where the user can select one recipe and replace it with another.

-Add a feature where the user can select a recipe and demand more info

-Make sure whenever ingredients are added, containing spaces (for example "geraspte kaas") this won't cause any problmes
(right now the space is removed and "kaas" will be seen as the unit. (same for gerapste_kaas etc...)
